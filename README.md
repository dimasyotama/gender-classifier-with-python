# gender-classifier-with-python

first thing first,Thank for the ebook from PACKTUB Artificial Intellegence with Python and Machine Learning with Python
You must download the modul for machine learning(on code) and imporant thing you must install Python version 2.7 or 3.6
I suggest use Python 3.6 for updated module

Installing modul on python :

Windows :

```pip install nltk```
Ubuntu or Linux :

```sudo pip install nltk```


enjoy coding everyone
